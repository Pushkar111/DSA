/*
1) root           -> Top Most node
2) node           -> Each element in Binary Tree is node
3) Parent & Child -> node considered as parent when node consists left and right child
4) Leaf           -> node which does not have any child
    â†“
  (External / Terminal) 
5) SubTree        -> set of nodes which are connected with root
6) Depth          -> Number of edges in the path from root to that node
7) Height         -> Maximum number of edges in the path from root to any leaf node
8) Sibling        -> nodes which have same parent
9) Degree         -> no of Direct children

==> Binary Tree   -> Tree of Degree 2
                    (nodes can have 0, 1, 2 children)
                  -> Ideal for representing hierarchical data
                  -> n nodes => edges ==> n-1
