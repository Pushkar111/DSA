A linked-list is a sequential list of nodes that hold data which point to other nodes also containing data.


### Pros and Cons
| | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Singly Linked List | - Uses Less Memory | Can't easily access previous elements |
| | - Simpler Implementation | |
| Doubly Linked List | - Can be Traversed backwards | Takes 2x memory |
