# Performance 

## Performance
    Let n be the number of elements in the stack. The complexities for operations with this representation can be given as:
| Operation | Complexity |
| --- | :---: |
| Space Complexity (for n push operations) | O(n) |
| Time Complexity of Push Operation | O(1) |
| Time Complexity of Pop Operation | O(1) |
| Time Complexity of Peek Operation | O(1) |
| Time Complexity of printing the Stack | O(n) |
| Time Complexity of Deleting complete Stack  | O(n) |
