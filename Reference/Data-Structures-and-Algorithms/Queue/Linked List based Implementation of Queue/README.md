# Performance and Limitations

### Performance:
    Let n be the number of elements in the queue, then :
| Operation | Complexity |
| --- | --- |
| Space Complexity (for n EnQueue operations) | O(n) |
| Time Complexity of EnQueue() | O(1) (Average)|
| Time Complexity of DeQueue() | O(1) |
| Time Complexity of printing the Queue | O(n) |
